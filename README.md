# ZBChecker
Amazing tool for Minecraft checking, made by Java.  
Cloud Mode that based Github Action can help you check your combos in the cloud and not requires a server!  
(Completed, but the work of instructions writing have not finished yet)
## I wrote this program just to complete a bet with a friend, I lost, so I need to use Java to write a checker.
At present, the function of this checker is not perfect, but I have plans to continue to do it.  
I am currently working hard to complete an [exam about the future of Chinese junior high school students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_High_School_Entrance_Examination) these months, so I will have little or scattered time to maintain all the ongoing projects under my GitHub account.  
After my return, I will focus on the checking research of the new Microsoft account instead of the Mojang account that will be cancelled soon. So the current version of the update plan is not finalized, maybe my classmates will help me improve the current features and what I have headache about, but who knows?  
#### Please forgive me for my delayed reply. Many times I have received messages, but I just can't find the time to reply!
